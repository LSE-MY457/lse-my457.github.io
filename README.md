**Following along**: Feel free to fork this repo and clone it to your local machine, then sync your fork and pull from the synced repo periodically to stay up to date. Or you can just follow along on the website. 

**Special thanks**: This course has benefitted tremendously from materials made available by a number of outstanding scholars and teachers. I would especially like to thank Jens Hainmueller, Dominik Hangartner, and Teppei Yamamoto on whose materials this course draws heavily, and to Kiril Borusyak, Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham, and Peter Hull for their publicly available materials.
